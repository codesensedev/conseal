 * conseal/circle — Multi-device private communication.
 *
 * Establishes a bounded group of trusted devices that all hold the same
 * Account Encryption Key (AEK). Encrypted data written on any device can be
 * decrypted on any other device in the circle.
 *
 * Four exported functions cover the full device-registration ceremony:
 *
 *   initCircle()        — founding device generates the shared AEK
 *   createJoinRequest() — new device generates an ephemeral ECDH key pair
 *   authorizeJoin()     — trusted device seals the AEK for the new device
 *   finalizeJoin()      — new device unseals and re-wraps the AEK
 *
 * secretKey (Uint8Array) is required for all four functions — passphrase-only
 * wrapping does not meet the security bar for multi-device sync. Each device
 * must hold a Secret Key via one of the three SK strategies (OS keychain,
 * IndexedDB non-extractable, or WebAuthn PRF).
 *
 * Composes: aes.ts, pbkdf2.ts, ecdh.ts, jwk.ts, digest.ts
 * No custom cryptography — correct composition of audited primitives only.
