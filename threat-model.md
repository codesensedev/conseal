# Conseal — Threat Model

> **Version:** April 2026  
> **Scope:** `conseal` library v0.x – v1.x  
> **Audience:** Integrators, security reviewers, and auditors.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines:

- What **threat actors** conseal is designed to resist.
- What **property** each defence provides.
- What conseal **explicitly does not protect against** — and why.
- What **assumptions callers must satisfy** for the security properties to hold.

---

## 2. System Summary

Conseal is a browser-side cryptography library built entirely on the [Web Crypto API](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/) (`SubtleCrypto`). Its central promise is **zero-knowledge architecture**: the server stores only ciphertext and wrapped keys — never plaintext and never bare key material. All cryptographic operations occur inside the browser.

### Key assets

| Asset | Description | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **AEK** (Account Encryption Key) | Root AES-256-GCM key; all user data is encrypted with it | IndexedDB (non-extractable `CryptoKey`) |
| **Wrapped AEK** | AEK protected by PBKDF2 + AES-KW | Server / cloud storage |
| **Secret Key (SK)** | 128-bit second factor for AEK wrapping | Device-local storage (e.g. `localStorage`) |
| **Passphrase** | Human-chosen credential; combined with SK into PBKDF2 | User's memory only |
| **Plaintext** | Application data before encryption | Exists only transiently in JavaScript memory |
| **Ciphertext** | AES-256-GCM encrypted application data | Server / cloud storage |
| **ECDH / ECDSA key pairs** | Per-user asymmetric keys for messaging and signing | Server (public key) / IndexedDB (private key) |
| **BIP-39 mnemonic** | 24-word phrase derived from AEK for offline backup | User's written record only |

---

## 3. Threat Actors

### 3.1 Malicious or compromised server

**Capability:** Full access to the database — ciphertext, wrapped keys, salts, public keys.

**What the attacker gains:**
- Ciphertext blobs — useless without the AEK.
- Wrapped AEK + salt — useless without the passphrase and (if used) the Secret Key.
- ECDH / ECDSA public keys — non-sensitive by design.
- No access to the plaintext AEK, the Secret Key, or the passphrase.

**Conseal's defence:** PBKDF2 with 600,000 HMAC-SHA-256 iterations makes offline passphrase guessing expensive. Combined with a 128-bit Secret Key (which never reaches the server), the server cannot brute-force the wrapping key even with indefinite compute time.

**Residual risk:** A weak passphrase without a Secret Key reduces to the strength of that passphrase alone. Callers should enforce minimum passphrase strength or mandate Secret Key use.

---

### 3.2 Network attacker (passive or active MitM)

**Capability:** Observe and/or modify HTTP traffic.

**What the attacker gains with TLS:**
- Nothing useful — all transmitted data is ciphertext or wrapped keys.

**What the attacker gains without TLS:**
- Could substitute a malicious JavaScript bundle, defeating all security properties.

**Conseal's defence:** Not in scope — conseal does not manage transport. callers **must** serve their application over HTTPS.

---

### 3.3 Offline brute-force against a stolen wrapped key

**Capability:** Offline dictionary or brute-force attack on a `{ wrappedKey, salt }` pair retrieved from the server or a backup.

**Conseal's defence:**
- PBKDF2 at 600,000 iterations ≈ 200–500 ms per guess on modern hardware.
- A 128-bit random Secret Key raises the effective key space to 2¹²⁸ · |passphrase space|, making exhaustive search infeasible even with specialised hardware.
- Each salt is randomly generated per wrap, so pre-computation (rainbow table) attacks do not apply.

---

### 3.4 Passive logging or key escrow by the library

**Capability:** Concern that conseal silently exfiltrates key material.

**Conseal's defence:** The library is open-source and auditable. It makes no network requests. Key material is passed only to `SubtleCrypto`, which enforces `extractable: false` on stored keys — preventing JavaScript code (including conseal itself) from reading raw key bytes out of IndexedDB.

---

### 3.5 Tampering with ciphertext in transit or storage

**Capability:** Flip bits in a stored or transmitted ciphertext.

**Conseal's defence:** AES-256-GCM is an authenticated encryption scheme. Any modification to the ciphertext, the IV, or the AAD (if used) causes `unseal()` / `unsealMessage()` / `unsealEnvelope()` to throw a `DOMException` — the tampered bytes are never returned to the caller. There is no "decrypt-and-ignore-the-tag" path.

---

## 4. What Conseal Does NOT Protect Against

### 4.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Threat:** Injected JavaScript in the same origin can call `conseal.seal()`, `conseal.unseal()`, and `loadCryptoKey()` directly. Non-extractable `CryptoKey` objects cannot have their bytes read, but the attacker can still use them to encrypt, decrypt, or sign arbitrary data.

**Why conseal cannot fix this:** XSS breaks the browser's same-origin security boundary. Once arbitrary JavaScript executes on your page, it can use every API — including conseal's — as legitimately as your own code. This is an application-layer problem.

**Caller responsibility:** Implement a strict [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), sanitise all user-supplied HTML, and follow OWASP XSS prevention guidelines. Do not execute untrusted scripts in the same origin as the encrypted data.

---

### 4.2 Server Compromise with Key Theft

**Threat:** An attacker who compromises the server and can also intercept the user's next login receives the wrapped AEK and then observes the passphrase (e.g. via a malicious API response that logs the passphrase before wrapping).

**Why conseal cannot fix this:** conseal wraps keys on the client, but if the attacker controls the page delivery they can serve modified JavaScript. This is the classic "server compromise breaks client-side crypto" problem.

**Caller responsibility:** Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all scripts, deploy to a platform with tamper-evident deployments, and consider a Security Policy. Monitor for unexpected changes to served JavaScript.

---

### 4.3 Side-Channel Attacks

**Threat:** Timing attacks, cache-timing, power analysis, or EM side-channels against the cryptographic operations.

**Why conseal cannot fix this:** These attacks target the hardware or the browser's `SubtleCrypto` implementation. conseal has no influence over CPU caches, OS schedulers, or physical hardware. Mitigating hardware side-channels (e.g. Spectre, Meltdown) is the responsibility of browser vendors and the OS.

**Caller responsibility:** If your threat model includes nation-state-level physical access, conseal is not the right layer to address it. Rely on the browser vendor's mitigations for Spectre-class attacks.

---

### 4.4 Key Leakage via JavaScript Memory

**Threat:** Key material that passes through JavaScript (e.g. the passphrase string, the raw bytes returned from `toBase64` helpers) may remain in memory and be accessible to a memory-scanning attacker.

**What conseal does:** AEK and wrapped keys are kept as native `CryptoKey` objects wherever possible. Raw bytes only exist transiently during wrapping/unwrapping.

**What conseal cannot do:** JavaScript does not have manual memory management. String and `Uint8Array` values cannot be zeroed; the garbage collector decides when memory is freed. A sufficiently powerful attacker who can scan the JS heap may find transient key bytes.

---

### 4.5 Weak Passphrases

**Threat:** A passphrase chosen from a small dictionary ("123456", "password") dramatically shrinks the effective key space regardless of iteration count.

**Conseal's position:** Passphrase quality is an application policy decision. conseal does not validate entropy.

**Caller responsibility:** Enforce minimum passphrase length and entropy, or use `generateSecretKey()` to make the iteration count irrelevant to server-side brute force.

---

### 4.6 Loss of the Secret Key

**Threat:** If the Secret Key is lost (device destroyed, `localStorage` cleared, no backup) and the user has not retained their BIP-39 mnemonic, the AEK cannot be recovered — all encrypted data is permanently inaccessible.

**This is by design.** Conseal enforces zero-knowledge by ensuring the server cannot recover the AEK on the user's behalf. Irrecoverability is the flip side of that guarantee.

**Caller responsibility:** Display clear UX prompting users to store their mnemonic and Secret Key before performing destructive operations. Consider offering a "recovery export" step during account setup.

---

### 4.7 BIP-39 Mnemonic Exposure

**Threat:** The 24-word mnemonic is a complete export of the AEK. Anyone who obtains it can reconstruct the AEK and decrypt all data.

**Conseal's position:** The mnemonic is intended for offline backup (written on paper, stored in a password manager). It should never be transmitted unencrypted or displayed without user intent.

**Caller responsibility:** Display the mnemonic only on user request, prompt the user to acknowledge its sensitivity, and never log it or transmit it to a server.

## 5. Caller Assumptions

The security properties documented here hold **only if** the following conditions are satisfied:

| # | Assumption | Consequence of violation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The application is served over **HTTPS** with a valid certificate | A network attacker can substitute a malicious JavaScript bundle |
| 2 | The application enforces a **strict Content Security Policy** preventing inline scripts and untrusted sources | XSS can call conseal APIs directly and access all IndexedDB keys |
| 3 | **Passphrases** are chosen with adequate entropy, or a Secret Key is always used | Offline brute-force against a stolen wrapped key becomes feasible |
| 4 | The **Secret Key** (if used) is not stored on the server or in any server-readable location | The server-compromise defence collapses |
| 5 | The **BIP-39 mnemonic** is treated as a high-secrets credential (offline storage only) | A single leak allows full AEK reconstruction |
| 6 | The application does not **eval** or execute untrusted scripts in the same origin | Equivalent to assumption 2; any arbitrary script can use loaded `CryptoKey` objects |
| 7 | The browser's `SubtleCrypto` implementation is **not compromised** | All cryptographic operations are delegated to the browser; a backdoored browser breaks everything |
| 8 | `init()` is called before any `seal()` / `unseal()` operation | Without a loaded AEK, encryption will throw or fall back to an unexpected key |

---

## 6. Cryptographic Algorithm Choices

| Primitive | Algorithm | Parameters | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Symmetric encryption | AES-GCM | 256-bit key, 12-byte IV, 128-bit tag | NIST standard; authenticated; hardware-accelerated in all modern CPUs and browsers |
| Key derivation | PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 | 600,000 iterations, 16-byte random salt | RFC 8018; NIST SP 800-132 recommendation ≥ 210,000 for SHA-256; broad browser support |
| Key wrapping | AES-KW | 256-bit wrapping key | RFC 3394; deterministic and safe for already-random key material |
| Key agreement | ECDH | NIST P-256 | Widely available in SubtleCrypto; adequate for the threat model; no dependencies |
| Signatures | ECDSA | NIST P-256, SHA-256 | Same rationale as ECDH; P-256 is the baseline curve in WebCrypto |
| Hashing | SHA-256 | — | Universal; used as PBKDF2 PRF and standalone digest |
| Mnemonic encoding | BIP-39 | 24 words (256-bit entropy + 8-bit checksum) | Human-writeable offline backup; well-specified; implemented by `@scure/bip39` |
| Randomness | `crypto.getRandomValues` | — | CSPRNG; provided by the browser/OS; no user-space RNG |

## 7. Out-of-Scope Items

The following are **deliberately outside conseal's scope**:

- **Transport security** — use HTTPS / TLS.
- **Authentication** — use a dedicated auth layer (passwords, WebAuthn, OAuth).
- **Access control** — decide who may call your API before passing data to conseal.
- **Post-quantum cryptography** — none of the required algorithms are yet mandated for browser use; conseal will revisit when `SubtleCrypto` adds post-quantum primitives.
- **Obfuscation** — conseal does not hide that data is encrypted.
- **Anonymity** — conseal does not hide who is communicating with whom.

## 8. Reporting Security Issues

Please follow the [responsible disclosure process](../SECURITY.md) rather than opening a public issue. Encryption bugs are treated with the highest priority.
